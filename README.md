With this private project I attempted to recreate/copy an existing website without looking at the original source code (recreate it by just looking at the actual site in my browser). The existing website that I set out to recreate was a template I took from Themezy.com. Working like this enables me to focus solely on practicing my code, and focus less on design-specific matters.

DISCLAIMER: This website is a personal recreation of an already existing website template which is designed by Themezy.com. I do not claim ownership nor credit for the design and all rights belong to Themezy.com. I have used their template for educational purposes only and again do not claim it as my own.

This website is a one-page landing page for an investment company.

Personal notes on project: 

- although the website is relatively simple, it challenged me to do things I had not done before which is why I chose this particular website to recreate.

- where I had struggled a lot doing media queries in my last project (the fittie fitness site) I noticed that with this page I struggled much less and it all went rather fluently.

- point of attention is still that I do not use Git properly.

- overall, writing the code for this website was easier than I expected it to be and I should take on a bigger challenge for my next project.
